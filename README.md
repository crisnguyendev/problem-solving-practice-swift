# Problem Solving Practice Repository

Welcome to my Problem Solving Practice repository! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills using **Swift**. It focuses on mastering algorithms and data structures through hands-on practice and challenges. Problems are sourced from platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode, as well as structured courses designed for systematic learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- **Strengthen Algorithmic Thinking:** Sharpen your ability to design and analyze algorithms.
- **Enhance Swift Proficiency:** Build efficient and idiomatic Swift solutions.
- **Prepare for Interviews:** Develop a portfolio of problems and solutions that mirror real coding interview challenges.
- **Optimize Your Code:** Learn to write code that is both clear and performant.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### Fundamentals
- Arrays and Strings
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast and Slow Pointers

### Sorting and Searching
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Modified Binary Search

### Prefix Techniques

### Trees and Graphs
- Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Tree Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Topological Sort (Graph)
- Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS)
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall)

### Dynamic Programming
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Common Substring
- Advanced Dynamic Programming

### Bitwise and Subset Problems
- Bitwise XOR
- Subsets
- Bit Manipulation Techniques

### Greedy Algorithms & Divide and Conquer
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
- Greedy Strategies
- Divide and Conquer

### Advanced Topics (Custom Implementations Required in Swift)
- **Two Heaps (Priority Queues):** Swift doesnâ€™t offer a built-in heap, so you'll need to implement min-heap or max-heap structures yourself.
- **K-way Merge:** Often combined with custom heap implementations.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree):** No native trie exists, so you'll build one from scratch.
- **Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees:** These require custom code as they are not supported out of the box.
- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find):** Implement your own union-find structure.
- **Computational Geometry and Number Theory:** These topics might require special libraries or custom functions.
- **String Matching Algorithms:** Implement KMP, Rabin-Karp, and Z-Algorithm manually.

> **Review Note:**  
> Among these topics, **Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees**, **Tries**, **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**, and **Heaps** are notably not well-supported by Swiftâ€™s built-in libraries. Youâ€™ll need to build these from the ground up or leverage third-party libraries if available.
